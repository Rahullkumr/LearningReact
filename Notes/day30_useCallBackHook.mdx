- jab fn ko props me pass krnge tub child component re-render hoga (its the problem), thats why new hook was introduced
    - new hook is: useCallback()

- it returns a memoized function, useMemo() returns memoized value

- syntax:
    ```js
    let func = useCallback(cbf, dependencyArray)
    ```

- jab dependencyArray me change hoga tub pura cbf re create hoga 

- `Memoization` a technique 

- vvi useMemo(), useCallback()
